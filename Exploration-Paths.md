# Docker Exploration Paths

Where to head to?

## Laptop

1. Understanding Docker and how to use it from the command-line
2. Creation of a Docker image from scratch, from an Ubuntu distribution

## Server

3. Installation of the Docker Engine bare-metal on a dedicated server
4. Deployment to a Docker Engine on this remote host
5. Updating the docker image and hot-redeployment to a Docker Engine on a remote host (how to architecture the thing so that the data remains on the host?)

## Cloud

6. Composing an app from multiple Docker images
7. Provisioning the Docker VMs composing the app on a Cloud and deploying the Docker images
